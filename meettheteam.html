	<h2>Brodie Colvin - s3515209 <a href="https://slurgen.github.io/Boiler-room/">github page</a></h2>
        <p>I live in Wagga Wagga NSW Australia. My personal interests are Online gaming, online interactions using streaming utilities as well as up-cycling or repurposing old hardware and semi obsolete platforms to increase usability longevity. My experience in IT is mainly online collaboration (multiplayer gaming) I have built many PCs from standard boxes to high end performance gaming machines. 
 I live on a large complex and basically administrate a medium network consisting of multiple routers and wifi hotspots. </p>
        <h2>Chris Hole - s3814641 <a href="https://Chris771.github.io/index1.html">github page</a></a></h2>
        <p>I live in the outer east suburbs of Victoria. I have two children, 11 and 9 and two dogs just over a year old. They are a rottwieler and a german shepherd. I worked as a disability carer for 18 years but have now injured myself and am not working. I like to read and really love watching zombie tv shows and movies. 
 I have always had an interest in IT. 
Computers have always been a big part of my life. We had an old apple mac in our house when I was young and I learned to type on it. The typing game and one other were the only games that were available on the mac so there wasnâ€™t much to choose from. 
I completed year 11 and 12 IT while I was still in year 10. I should have really listened to my Dad when he told me to stick with IT when I was 18. Lesson learned!!! 
I am completing two subjects with RMIT through open universities this year, Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming. I am hoping to get into a Bachelor of cyber security/Criminology next year. </p>
<h2>Jennifer Sanderson - s3818848 </h2>
        <p>Born in the country town of Tawonga, Victoria,  moved to Melbourne from the age of six until 15 years old, then moved to the Mornington Peninsula where I have lived since.  I was young when I married my Husband and had 4 children by age 27, all with families of their own. My hobbies are Photography and Scrapbooking. I also love travelling around Australia as there are some many beautiful places to go.
 My interest in IT began when I bought my first personal computer and I learnt what could be created, such as games, different types of programs and software.  I learnt some basics using DOS as well. In doing this course I hope to increase my knowledge and improve my understanding of using my computer. The advancements made in IT continually amaze me to a point where I wonder, what will be invented next. </p>
